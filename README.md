This is a basic calendar application that allows users to schedule their day. Users can write and edit their plans in the different time slots by 
clicking over the text area. The save button saves the page after user are done editing their tasks. Local storage is used to store the tasks, and is cleared each night to be blank for the next day. The background colors correspond to how close the task is to due. And finally the header dialpays the current date.
